# 🧮 LeetCode 3512 – Minimum Operations to Make Array Sum Divisible by K

## 🔍 Problem
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the **minimum number of operations** required to make the **sum of the array divisible by k**.

---

## 💡 Intuition
The sum is divisible by `k` if:

sum(nums) % k == 0

If the sum is not divisible, the smallest number of operations needed to fix the divisibility is exactly the **remainder** of this division.

---

## ✔️ Approach
1. Compute the sum of all elements.
2. Compute `sum % k`.
3. This remainder is the minimum operations needed.

---

## ⏱ Complexity
- **Time:** O(n)
- **Space:** O(1)

---

## 🧑‍💻 Java Solution

```java
public class Solution {

    // Function to calculate minimum operations
    public int minOperations(int[] nums, int k) {
        int sum = 0;

        for (int num : nums) {
            sum += num;
        }

        // Minimum operations needed is the remainder itself
        return sum % k;
    }

    // Main method for testing
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution obj = new Solution();

        int[] nums = {1, 2, 3, 4};
        int k = 5;

        int result = obj.minOperations(nums, k);
        System.out.println("Minimum operations needed: " + result);
    }
}
🧪 Example
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 5  
Output: 0
